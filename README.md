(TWO SUM)
- Two Sum is a common programming problem where you are given a list of numbers and a target value, and your task is to find two different numbers in the list whose sum equals the target and return their indices.


## Difficulty Level
- Easy


## Description
- Given an array of integers and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. Each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.
